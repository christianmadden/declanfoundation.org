  <h1>The Declan Foundation</h1>

  <p>
    The mission of the Declan Foundation is to help create a world that our beloved Declan would love if he
    were still with us.
    <!--
    His time with us was brief, but we will honor him by supporting causes he would believe in
    if he were here with us, living a long and full life,  as an infant, a child, an adolescent,
    a young man, an adult and a wise old grandfather.
